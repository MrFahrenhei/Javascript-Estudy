        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>You're just too good to be true<br>
            I can't take my eyes off you<br>
            You'd be like heaven to touch<br>
            I wanna hold you so much<br>
            At long last love has arrived<br>
            And I thank God I'm alive<br>
            You're just too good to be true<br>
            Can't take my eyes off you<br>
            Pardon the way that I stare<br>
            There's nothing else to compare<br>
            The sight of you leaves me weak<br>
            There are no words left to speak<br>
            But if you feel like I feel<br>
            Please let me know that is real<br>
            You're just too good to be true<br>
            I can't take my eyes off you</p>
    </body>
